   Copy this file to the directory above this one, and change the definitions below as needed.

   This file contains installation-specific definitions that should not be versioned --- your copied file will not be pushed to git.

   One reason why we don't put this info in git is that it can (and is) different on different peoples' machines, e.g. where CATSLIB and SEEDROOT live.

   Another reason is we don't ever want to put the db passwords in a versioned file, because everyone can see our files on github.

// Several file/dir locations are assumed in catslib/_config.php, e.g. CATSDIR_IMG but they can be overridden if you specify them below.
// Put installation-specific definitions here, instead of in a cloned file, so they are not checked into git.
